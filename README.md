# bioinformatics-DNA
Web App deployed using Streamlit to **count** and **display** the number of Nucleotides in a strand of input DNA.

### Steps to run :

Apart from having Python3, you need to have streamlit up and running on your machine. This can be done by running the following command on your Terminal.

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Next, you should have the Pandas Library to create the DataFrame of Nucleotide. Run the following line on your Terminal.

```bash
pip install pandas
```

To fire up and run the app, use this command in the directory where the actual application file is located.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
